# Prompt Log â€” User Requests

This file logs every user prompt that resulted in a significant change to the codebase. It serves as metadata for understanding the conversational flow and how to replicate the development process.

Each entry is numbered sequentially and referenced from `docs/DesignWalkthrough.md` using the format `[Prompt #N]`.

---

### Entry #1 â€” 2025-10-15 14:45
> "create github-copilot instructions to make sure that every change is monitored to why and how...logs this to the necessary documentation file(s)"

---

### Entry #2 â€” 2025-10-15 14:50
> "Add to the copilot instructions to also document/log my prompts...it's good metadata that will show me how to get to stuff. If you want, you can log the prompts in a separate file, and reference to it from the #file:DesignWalkthrough.md"

### Entry #3 â€” 2025-10-15 15:10
> "I want to be able to simply save .kql files in a workspace, and that the MCP will pick up these queries as context for resolving KQL. Remember I should have the option to 'save a query', in that case, the query should be saved as a readable .kql file in my workspace, with explanation on top of the query to have enough context about it for future reference."

---

### Entry #4 â€” 2025-10-15 15:20
> "I see you're not saving all my prompts. Update #file:copilot-instructions.md to make sure you do so."

---

### Entry #6 â€” 2025-10-15 15:30

### Entry #10 â€” 2025-10-15 15:50

No embeddings - filter by folder/filename (non-LLM), then LLM for similarity 6. Marketplace extension (free) 7. MCP starts when needed, or auto-start 8. Webview for results 9. Automatic MCP registration 10. Let queries fail with error (agent retries) - make retry count a setting 11. What is PII Sanitization? 12. Strict .kql format"

### Entry #21 â€” 2025-10-15 16:45
> "### Entry #21 â€” 2025-10-15 16:45
> "Here are my answers: 1. MCP backend doesn't translate NL to KQL. The LLM (GitHub Copilot in VSCode) analyzes the user's natural language query and generates search terms. The MCP backend searches local .kql files and external references by content/filename using those search terms, then returns matching query examples to the LLM. The LLM decides which examples are similar and generates the final KQL based on the most relevant examples. This keeps the MCP simple: it's a search engine, not a translator. 2. Use the formal MCP JSON-RPC protocol (Model Context Protocol specification from Anthropic) â€” not just a custom REST API. This ensures compatibility with VSCode's MCP integration. 3. Monorepo with separate folders for MCP backend and VSCode extension (packages/mcp/ and packages/extension/). Single build command builds both packages. Single GitHub repository. 4. Extension naming: Display name 'BC Telemetry Buddy', package name 'bc-telemetry-buddy', publisher 'waldo'. 5. GitHub API authentication: Unauthenticated API access (60 requests/hour rate limit) â€” sufficient for fetching reference KQL from known repositories. Client can configure personal access token later if needed. 6. Web scraping: Deferred to v2 â€” focus on GitHub API for external references first. 7. Logging: MCP backend uses console output (for debugging), VSCode extension uses VSCode Output Channel (standard extension logging). 8. Workspace discovery: Extension passes workspace path to MCP backend via environment variable when spawning the MCP process. 9. MCP process lifecycle: One MCP process per workspace â€” extension spawns MCP on-demand (when workspace settings exist and user triggers query). 10. TypeScript configuration: ES2022 with ESM modules (modern JavaScript, better for MCP protocol compatibility)."

I don't see how the MCP can do the natural language part. The idea is that the MCP gives back possible queries for the LLM to interpret, no? ... Well - the pattern matching does have advantages, just make clear to the LLM that that's what happening, and that's the only thing it should expect from the tool. So option b I guess"
