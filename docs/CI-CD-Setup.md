## 🔑 Required Secrets (Action Items)

Configure these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Purpose | Get From | Required For |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `AI_CONNECTION_STRING` | Azure Application Insights telemetry | Azure Portal | **Release builds** |
| `VSCE_PAT` | VS Code Marketplace publishing | https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage | Extension releases |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Coverage reports (optional) | https://codecov.io/ | CI (optional) |
| `OVSX_PAT` | Open VSX publishing (optional) | https://open-vsx.org/ | Extension releases (optional) |

### ⚡ NEW: Application Insights Telemetry

The project now includes **usage telemetry** to track extension/MCP usage (not BC telemetry data).

**How CI/CD injects the connection string:**
- **CI builds** (test/PR): Empty connection string → No telemetry sent
- **Release builds** (tags): Injects `AI_CONNECTION_STRING` → Telemetry enabled in published artifacts

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create/select an Application Insights resource in Azure Portal
2. Copy the **Connection String** from Overview page
3. Add to GitHub secrets as `AI_CONNECTION_STRING`
4. See **`docs/GitHub-Secrets-Setup.md`** for detailed instructions

**Security Safeguards (IMPORTANT):**
- ✅ Set up Azure Cost Budget alerts ($50/month starting point)
- ✅ Configure anomaly detection alerts (ingestion volume, error rate)
- ✅ Client-side rate limiting is already implemented in code
- ✅ Connection string rotation procedure documented

**What gets tracked:**
- Extension activation, command usage, error rates
- MCP tool invocations, query performance
- No PII, no user code, no sensitive data
- Respects VS Code telemetry settings (off/crash/error/all)

See `Instructions/Telemetry-Design-and-Implementation.md` for full design details.

### Steps to Get `VSCE_PAT`:
1. Go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
2. Create publisher account (e.g., `waldo` or `waldo1001`)
3. Click "New Token" → Name: "GitHub Actions" → Organization: All accessible organizations → Scopes: **Marketplace → Manage**
3. Copy token and add to GitHub repository secrets as `VSCE_PAT`

### npm publishing (MCP): no token
MCP releases publish through npm **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**: no secret. On npmjs.com → package `bc-telemetry-buddy-mcp` → **Settings → Trusted Publisher → GitHub Actions**: user `waldo1001`, repository `waldo.BCTelemetryBuddy`, workflow `release-mcp.yml`, environment empty. The publish jobs request `id-token: write` and upgrade to npm ≥ 11.5.1 (Node 22 ships npm 10, which can't publish over OIDC). Provenance is attached automatically (the repo is public).

A new trusted-publisher configuration has to complete a publish within **2 days** or it expires, so configure it right before a release. After the first successful OIDC publish, set the package's **Publishing access** to *Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens* (#137).

See **`docs/GitHub-Secrets-Setup.md`** for complete instructions for all secrets.

## 📋 Recommended Branch Protection Rules

Configure for `main` branch in **Settings → Branches**:

✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging**
- Number of required approvals: 1

✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- Require branches to be up to date
- Required checks:
  - `Test MCP Backend (18.x)`
  - `Test MCP Backend (20.x)`
  - `Test VSCode Extension (ubuntu-latest, 18.x)`
  - `Test VSCode Extension (ubuntu-latest, 20.x)`
  - `Lint & Format Check`
  - `Build All Packages`
  - `Analyze Code`

✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

✅ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**

## 🚀 Release Process

### Automated Release (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json files
npm version patch --workspace=packages/extension  # or minor, major
npm version patch --workspace=packages/mcp

# 2. Update CHANGELOGs
# Edit packages/extension/CHANGELOG.md
# Edit packages/mcp/CHANGELOG.md
# Edit docs/CHANGELOG.md

# 3. Commit and tag
git add .
git commit -m "chore: release v0.1.0"
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main --tags

# 4. Workflow automatically:
#    - Runs all tests
#    - Builds packages
#    - Creates GitHub release
#    - Publishes to VS Code Marketplace
#    - Publishes to Open VSX Registry
```

### Manual Release

1. Go to **Actions → Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter version (e.g., `0.1.0`)
4. Check **Pre-release** if needed
5. Click **Run workflow**

## 🎯 What This Enables

✅ **Automated Testing**: Every PR and push tested on 3 OSes and 2 Node versions (18 test runs total)
✅ **Code Quality**: 70% coverage enforced, TypeScript compilation checked
✅ **Security**: CodeQL scans weekly, dependency vulnerabilities blocked in PRs
✅ **Dependency Management**: Automated PRs for dependency updates every Monday
✅ **Streamlined Releases**: One git tag triggers full release pipeline
✅ **Multi-Platform Publishing**: VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX Registry
✅ **Issue Tracking**: Structured templates guide bug reports and feature requests
✅ **PR Quality**: Auto-labeling, templates ensure consistent PR format

## 🧪 Testing the Workflows

### Locally (with `act`)

```powershell
# Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)
scoop install act  # Windows
# or: brew install act  # macOS

# Test CI workflow
act push -j test-mcp

# Test release workflow (dry-run)
act push -j build-and-test
```

### On GitHub

1. **Create a test PR** → CI workflow runs automatically
2. **Push to main** → CI workflow runs automatically
3. **Create test tag** → `git tag v0.0.1-test && git push --tags` → Release workflow runs (but won't publish without secrets)

## 📊 Monitoring

After setup, monitor:

- **Actions tab**: Workflow runs and logs
- **Security tab**: CodeQL alerts
- **Insights → Dependency graph**: Dependencies and vulnerabilities
- **Pull requests**: Dependabot PRs, auto-labels
- **Codecov dashboard**: Coverage trends (if configured)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First release will fail** until you configure `VSCE_PAT` secret
2. **Dependabot PRs** will start appearing next Monday (weekly schedule)
3. **CodeQL scan** will run weekly and on every push/PR
4. **Integration tests** are marked `continue-on-error: true` (experimental)
5. **Pre-releases** won't publish to marketplace automatically (manual workflow only)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

All CI/CD infrastructure is now in place. Next steps:

1. ✅ **Run E2E tests** (docs/E2E-TestScript.md)
2. ✅ **Configure GitHub secrets** (VSCE_PAT at minimum)
3. ✅ **Set up branch protection rules** (optional but recommended)
4. ✅ **Test workflows** (create a test PR)
5. ✅ **First release** (when E2E tests pass)
