The **Setup Wizard** provides a guided, 5-step process with validation and testing:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run: `BC Telemetry Buddy: Setup Wizard`
3. Follow the steps:
   - **Step 1 - Workspace Check**: Wizard verifies you have a workspace folder open
   - **Step 2 - Azure Configuration**: Enter your tenant ID, Application Insights App ID, and Kusto cluster URL
   - **Step 3 - Authentication**: Choose authentication method (Azure CLI recommended)
   - **Step 4 - Connection Testing**: Wizard validates settings and runs a test query
   - **Step 5 - Complete**: Settings are saved automatically, quick-start tips displayed

**Benefits**: No manual JSON editing, validation before saving, connection testing, clear error messages.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual configuration or need to review/edit settings:

### 1. Open Workspace Settings

Open your workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` file (or create it if it doesn't exist).

### 2. Add Required Settings

Add the following configuration (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.connectionName": "MyBC-Production",
  "bctb.mcp.tenantId": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "bctb.mcp.authFlow": "device_code",
  "bctb.mcp.applicationInsights.appId": "your-app-insights-id",
  "bctb.mcp.kusto.clusterUrl": "https://your-cluster.kusto.windows.net",
  "bctb.mcp.port": 52345,
  "bctb.mcp.cache.enabled": true,
  "bctb.mcp.cache.ttlSeconds": 3600
}
```

### 3. Get Your Application Insights Details

To find your Application Insights details:

1. Go to the **Azure Portal** (https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your **Application Insights** resource
3. Copy the **Application ID** from the Overview page
4. For **Kusto cluster URL**, use the BC telemetry endpoint:
   - Default: `https://ade.applicationinsights.io/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group}/providers/microsoft.insights/components/{app-insights-name}`
   - You can find this in the Application Insights resource under "API Access"

**Note**: The Setup Wizard pre-fills the Kusto cluster URL format for you.

### 4. Start the MCP Server

The MCP server starts automatically when you:
- Run a query via Command Palette
- Use Copilot to query telemetry
- Run the Setup Wizard

To manually start the server, open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and run:

```
BC Telemetry Buddy: Start MCP Server
```

The extension will:
- Validate your settings
- Start the MCP backend server
- Show a confirmation message when ready
- Display the server status in the Status Bar

---

## Authentication

BC Telemetry Buddy supports three authentication methods:

### Azure CLI (Recommended) ‚≠ê

**Best for:** Individual developers, interactive use, easiest setup

**How it works:**
1. Ensure you're logged in with Azure CLI: `az login`
2. The MCP server uses your existing Azure CLI credentials automatically
3. **No additional configuration needed** - just set `authFlow` to `azure_cli`

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No Azure app registration required
- ‚úÖ No device code prompts every time
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing Azure session
- ‚úÖ Works for all Azure resources you have access to

**To configure:**
```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.authFlow": "azure_cli"
}
```

**Note:** You don't need to specify `tenantId`, `clientId`, or `clientSecret` when using Azure CLI auth.

### Device Code Flow

**Best for:** When Azure CLI is not available, or for explicit browser-based auth

**How it works:**
1. The MCP server initiates device code authentication
2. You'll see a notification with a code and URL
3. Open the URL in your browser
4. Enter the code and sign in with your Azure account
5. Grant permissions when prompted
6. Return to VSCode ‚Äî you're authenticated!

**No Azure app registration required!** But you'll need to authenticate each time the MCP server starts.

**To configure:**
```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.authFlow": "device_code",
  "bctb.mcp.tenantId": "your-azure-tenant-id"
}
```

### Client Credentials Flow

**Best for:** Service accounts, CI/CD pipelines, unattended scenarios, automation

**How it works:**
1. Create an Azure service principal with Application Insights read permissions
2. Configure the client ID and secret
3. The MCP server authenticates automatically on startup

**To configure:**
```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.authFlow": "client_credentials",
  "bctb.mcp.tenantId": "your-azure-tenant-id",
  "bctb.mcp.clientId": "your-service-principal-client-id",
  "bctb.mcp.clientSecret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** For client credentials, consider using environment variables instead of storing secrets in settings:

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.clientId": "${env:BCTB_CLIENT_ID}",
  "bctb.mcp.clientSecret": "${env:BCTB_CLIENT_SECRET}"
}
```

---

## Using the Extension

BC Telemetry Buddy provides several commands accessible from the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P):

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `BC Telemetry Buddy: Start MCP Server` | Start the MCP backend server |
| `BC Telemetry Buddy: Run Natural Language Query` | Query telemetry using plain English |
| `BC Telemetry Buddy: Save Query` | Save a query as a `.kql` file |
| `BC Telemetry Buddy: Open Queries Folder` | Open saved queries folder in explorer |

---

## Querying Telemetry

### Using Natural Language (with GitHub Copilot)

GitHub Copilot provides the best experience with BC Telemetry Buddy through a **systematic discovery workflow**:

1. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Alt+I / Cmd+Alt+I)
2. Type your question in plain English:
   ```
   @workspace Show me all errors in the last 24 hours
   ```
3. **Copilot automatically follows this workflow:**
   - **Step 1 - Discover Events**: Calls `bctb_get_event_catalog` to find relevant event IDs (e.g., RT0010 for errors)
   - **Step 2 - Understand Schema**: Calls `bctb_get_event_schema` to see available customDimensions fields
   - **Step 3 - Check Saved Queries**: Searches workspace queries for similar patterns
   - **Step 4 - Execute Query**: Generates KQL and calls `bctb_query_telemetry` to run it
   - **Step 5 - Display Results**: Shows formatted results with recommendations

**For customer-specific queries**, Copilot adds a step:
```
@workspace Show me errors for customer Contoso in the last 24 hours
```
- Copilot calls `bctb_get_tenant_mapping` to map "Contoso" to its Azure tenant ID
- Then proceeds with the workflow above, filtering by `aadTenantId`

**Example queries:**
- "What are the slowest database operations today?"
- "Show me failed web service calls in the last hour"
- "How many sessions started in the past week for customer Fabrikam?"
- "Which reports are causing the most timeouts?"
- "What telemetry events are firing most frequently?"

### Using KQL Directly

If you know KQL, you can query directly:

**Via GitHub Copilot:**
```
@workspace Run this KQL: requests | where success == false | take 10
```

**Via Command Palette:**
1. Run `BC Telemetry Buddy: Run KQL Query`
2. Enter your KQL query in the input box
3. View results in a rich webview with tables, charts, and recommendations

**Via CodeLens in .kql files:**
1. Create or open a `.kql` file in your workspace
2. Write your KQL query
3. Click the "‚ñ∂ Run Query" CodeLens link that appears above the query
4. View results in the webview

### Discovering Available Events

Before querying, you can discover what telemetry events exist:

**Via Copilot:**
```
@workspace What telemetry events are available?
@workspace Show me the schema for event RT0005
```

**Manual Discovery:**
The extension exposes these tools to Copilot:
- **Event Catalog** (`bctb_get_event_catalog`): Lists recent BC telemetry event IDs with descriptions, frequency, and Learn URLs
- **Event Schema** (`bctb_get_event_schema`): Shows available customDimensions fields for a specific event ID

This helps you understand:
- What events are firing in your environment
- What data each event contains (customDimensions fields)
- How frequently events occur
- Microsoft Learn documentation for each event type

---

## Working with Customers (Tenant Mapping)

BC Telemetry Buddy includes powerful features for managing multi-customer environments:

### Automatic Company Discovery

When you query telemetry, the extension can discover all companies/customers in your Application Insights:

**Via Copilot:**
```
@workspace What companies do I have telemetry for?
```

Copilot calls `bctb_get_tenant_mapping` which:
- Scans recent telemetry (default: last 10 days)
- Extracts unique company names and their Azure tenant IDs
- Returns a mapping table for easy reference

### Customer-Specific Queries

When asking about a specific customer:

```
@workspace Show me errors for customer Contoso in the last week
```

**Copilot automatically:**
1. Calls `bctb_get_tenant_mapping` to find Contoso's tenant ID
2. Generates KQL with: `| where tostring(customDimensions.aadTenantId) == "{tenant-id}"`
3. Executes the query and returns customer-specific results

### Saving Customer Queries

When you save a query that filters by tenant/company, it's automatically organized:

**Generic queries** ‚Üí `queries/[Category]/[QueryName].kql`  
**Customer queries** ‚Üí `queries/Companies/[CompanyName]/[Category]/[QueryName].kql`

This keeps customer-specific queries isolated and easy to find.

---

## Saving Queries

When you find a useful query, save it for future reference and context building:

### Via Command

1. Run `BC Telemetry Buddy: Save Query`
2. Enter a **query name** (e.g., "Slow Dependencies")
3. Enter the **KQL query**
4. Optionally add a **description**
5. Optionally add **tags** (comma-separated)
6. Optionally specify a **company name** (for customer-specific queries)

The query is saved to `.vscode/bctb/queries/` (or `queries/Companies/{CompanyName}/` for customer queries) as a `.kql` file.

### Via GitHub Copilot

After executing a query via Copilot Chat:

```
@workspace Save this query as "Slow Dependencies" with tags: performance, database
```

### Query File Format

Saved queries follow this format:

```kql
// Query: Slow Database Dependencies
// Purpose: Find all database calls taking longer than 2 seconds
// Use case: Performance troubleshooting for slow pages
// Created: 2025-10-15 by @waldo
// Tags: performance, database, dependencies

dependencies
| where type == "SQL"
| where duration > 2000
| summarize count(), avg(duration), max(duration) by target, operation
| order by avg_duration desc
```

### Managing Saved Queries

- **Browse queries:** Run `BC Telemetry Buddy: Open Queries Folder`
- **Edit queries:** Open `.kql` files in VSCode and edit them directly
- **Delete queries:** Delete the `.kql` file
- **Share queries:** Commit `.kql` files to your team repository (ensure no PII!)

---

## External References

Improve query generation by configuring external KQL sources:

### Adding References

In your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.references": [
    {
      "name": "BC Telemetry Samples",
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Waldo's Blog",
      "type": "web",
      "url": "https://www.waldo.be/category/dynamics-nav-business-central/",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reference Types

- **`github`**: Fetches KQL examples from GitHub repositories
- **`web`**: Fetches KQL from blog posts and documentation (v2 feature)

### How It Works

When you query with natural language:
1. Copilot generates search terms
2. MCP searches your saved `.kql` files
3. MCP fetches and searches configured external references
4. All matching examples are returned to Copilot
5. Copilot generates the final KQL using the most relevant examples

**Benefits:**
- Better query accuracy with more context
- Learn from community examples
- Leverage official Microsoft samples
- Share knowledge across your team

### GitHub Copilot Integration

BC Telemetry Buddy exposes **10 MCP tools** to GitHub Copilot for comprehensive telemetry analysis.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | When Copilot Uses It |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Discovery Tools** |
| `bctb_get_event_catalog` | List available BC telemetry events with descriptions and frequency | When you ask generic questions about errors, performance, or "what's available" |
| `bctb_get_event_schema` | Get customDimensions fields for a specific event ID | After discovering relevant events, to understand available fields |
| `bctb_get_tenant_mapping` | Map company names to Azure tenant IDs | When you mention a specific customer/company name in your query |
| **Query Execution** |
| `bctb_query_telemetry` | Execute KQL or natural language queries | For every telemetry query (after discovery steps) |
| **Query Library** |
| `bctb_get_saved_queries` | List saved queries (with optional tag filtering) | To find existing patterns before generating new queries |
| `bctb_search_queries` | Search saved queries by keywords | When your question matches common patterns (errors, slow, login, etc.) |
| `bctb_save_query` | Save a successful query for future reference | When you ask to save a query or Copilot recommends saving |
| `bctb_get_categories` | List query categories/folders | To understand your workspace organization |
| **Analysis & Recommendations** |
| `bctb_get_recommendations` | Analyze results and provide actionable insights | After query execution, to suggest next steps or optimizations |
| `bctb_get_external_queries` | Fetch KQL examples from configured references | For additional context when generating queries |
| **Cache Management** |
| `bctb_get_cache_stats` | Get cache size and statistics | When you ask about cache performance |
| `bctb_clear_cache` | Clear all cached results | When you explicitly ask to clear cache |
| `bctb_cleanup_cache` | Remove only expired cache entries | For routine maintenance |

### Usage Examples

**Query telemetry:**
```
@workspace Show me all page view events from the last hour
```

**List saved queries:**
```
@workspace What saved queries do I have for performance analysis?
```

**Save a query:**
```
@workspace Save this query as "Error Summary" with tags: errors, monitoring
```

**Get recommendations:**
```
@workspace Analyze these errors and recommend fixes
```

### Context Awareness

Copilot automatically uses:
- ‚úÖ Your saved `.kql` queries
- ‚úÖ Configured external references (GitHub, docs)
- ‚úÖ Query execution history (cached results)
- ‚úÖ Workspace-specific settings

This context helps Copilot generate more accurate, relevant KQL queries.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Caching

Control query result caching:

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.cache.enabled": true,
  "bctb.mcp.cache.ttlSeconds": 3600  // 1 hour
}
```

Cache is stored in `.vscode/.bctb/cache/` (automatically excluded from git).

### PII Sanitization

Enable optional PII redaction (opt-in):

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.sanitize.removePII": true
}
```

When enabled, the MCP will redact:
- Email addresses
- IP addresses (partial)
- GUIDs (partial)
- Common PII patterns

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Business Central telemetry should not contain PII, but this provides an extra safety layer.

### Retry Configuration

Configure how many times Copilot retries failed queries:

```json
{
  "bctb.agent.maxRetries": 3
}
```

### Multiple Workspaces

Each workspace can have its own configuration:

- **Workspace A** (Production): Points to production Application Insights
- **Workspace B** (Test): Points to test environment
- **Workspace C** (Customer): Points to customer's tenant

Just configure different settings in each workspace's `.vscode/settings.json`.

### Custom Port

If port 52345 is already in use:

```json
{
  "bctb.mcp.port": 52346,
  "bctb.mcp.url": "http://localhost:52346"
}
```

## FAQ

### Do I need GitHub Copilot to use this extension?

No! You can use the extension without Copilot by:
- Running `BC Telemetry Buddy: Run Natural Language Query` command
- Writing KQL queries directly in saved `.kql` files
- Using the extension's commands to query and save queries

However, **Copilot integration provides the best experience** for natural language queries and contextual assistance.

### Will this work with GitHub Copilot Free?

Yes! BC Telemetry Buddy uses your existing GitHub Copilot license (Free, Pro, or Enterprise). No additional costs.

### Can I use this with multiple Business Central environments?

Yes! Each VSCode workspace can connect to a different Application Insights instance. Create separate workspace folders for each environment.

### Are my queries and telemetry data sent to OpenAI?

When using natural language queries with GitHub Copilot:
- Your **natural language question** is sent to Copilot's LLM
- **Saved query metadata** (comments, descriptions) is sent as context
- **External reference content** (KQL examples) is sent as context
- **Raw telemetry data** is NOT sent to the LLM (only query results summary if you ask for analysis)

The MCP backend runs locally and only sends what's necessary for query generation.

### Can I commit my `.kql` files to git?

**Yes!** Saved queries (`.kql` files) are designed to be committed and shared with your team. They:
- Should NOT contain PII or sensitive data
- Provide valuable knowledge base for your team
- Help everyone generate better queries

**Do NOT commit:**
- `.vscode/.bctb/cache/` (cached results)
- `.vscode/.bctb/references-cache/` (external references cache)
- Workspace settings with secrets

### How do I update the extension?

VSCode will automatically notify you when updates are available. You can also:
1. Go to Extensions
2. Find "BC Telemetry Buddy"
3. Click **Update** if available

### How do I uninstall?

1. Go to Extensions
